- 👋 Hi, I’m @FullValueRider. I'm not a professional programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about programming
- 🌱 I’m currently using VBA to write an flexible, easy to use, dictionary object (KVP) to facilitate writing answers to Advent of Code in VBA
- 💞️ I probably have insufficient proficiency to collaborate on anything
- 📫 My long time email address is slaycock@cix.co.uk
