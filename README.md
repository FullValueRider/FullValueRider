- 👋 Hi, I’m @FullValueRider. I'm not a professional programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about programming.
- As a hobby I try to solve Advent of Code problems using VBA (and more recently twinBasic) - See my AdventOfCode repository
- 🌱 I’m slowly creating a Library of VBA classes that are useful for solving Advent of Code Problems (See my VBALib repository)
- I also have a go at translating my VBA solution to other languages that I can get my head around.
- 💞️ I probably have insufficient proficiency to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 My long time email address is slaycock@cix.co.uk.
